4. Container Security Scanning:
Check container images for security issues and vulnerabilities, ensuring that your deployment environment is secure.

5. Secure Coding Practices Training:
Train developers in secure coding practices to minimize the introduction of security flaws during development.

6. Access Control and Permissions Review:
Regularly review and update access controls and permissions to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

7. Vulnerability Patching:
Keep software and libraries up to date by promptly applying security patches to address known vulnerabilities.

8. Incident Response Plan Testing:
Regularly test and update your incident response plan to ensure a swift and effective response to security incidents.

9. Security Documentation and Compliance Checks:
